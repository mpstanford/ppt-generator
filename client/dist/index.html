    <h2>How to use this tool:</h2>
    <p>1. Upload a CSV file below. Make sure it has the following columns: companyName, website, concept, metWith, riskOpp, keyFigures, briefSummary, mainTakeaways, keyConnections</p>
    <p>2. You may edit fields, reorder rows, deselect rows, and deselect fields. If a field is red, it means it's gone over the character limit and may not look good in your final presentation.</p>
    <p>3. Give your presentation a title, and click Download. That's it!</p>
