There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Summary ##
Now you can rapidly generate customized powerpoint presentations from a template based on CSV input. No more embarrassing typos, formatting inconsistencies, or tedious updates. 

## Problem ##
Many professionals, including marketers, consultants, and investment bankers, find themselves repeatedly generating very similar powerpoint presentations, each intended for a different audience. These presentations must be free of typos and inconsistencies, and they're tedious to maintain. 

## Solution ##
This is a customized solution for one company. Once users upload a CSV, the application maps column names to fields in the powerpoint template. Users can select which rows should be made into a slide, change slide order by dragging and dropping rows, and select which fields should be included. For example, different fields will be included for internal vs. external presentations. When ready, click to download your new, customized powerpoint.

Please contact us if you'd like us to build a customized version for your company! We are working on a feature that will allow users to add/edit/delete fields and change the formatting of the PowerPoint, but in the meantime, just tell us what you need and let us build it for you. Turnaround time is about 1 week.

## How to Get Started ##
Simply import a CSV that includes the data for each slide to be included in the powerpoint: Company Name, Website, Concept(s), Met with, Risk/Opportunity, Key Figures, Brief Summary, Main Takeaways, Potential Connections. You can generate as many powerpoint presentations as you'd like with this data, simply by clicking the "download powerpoint" button. Each time, you can reorder the company rows, select different fields for inclusion, and select different companies for inclusion.
